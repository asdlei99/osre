# OSRE - Just another Open Source Render Engine

Just another open-source renderer made by me for just playing around.

The core-features:
- Multithreaded rendering 
- Platform abstraction-layer
- OS-independent task-support to make multi-threaded rendering more easy
- Model-import provided by Asset-Importer-Lib ( see https://github.com/assimp/assimp )
- Bitmap-Font-Rendering
- Simple scenegraph-module
- Simple UI-module providing Panels Buttons and some more stuff ( under construction )
- CMake base build environment

# Getting started
## What you need to install it?
- A Linux or Windows-PC with a more or less modern GPU
- cmake to genreate the build environment for your platform ( see www.cmake.org )
- SDL2.0 ( see https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php )
- The rest comes out of the box!

## Build the engine from the source
Clone the repo via git from our project space on github.
```
> cd projects
> git clone https://github.com/kimkulling/osre.git
```
Now update all used submodule, which are usep by OSRE:
```
> git submodule init
> git submodule update -r
```
Generate a build environment of your choice ( you can choose your own build environment by selecting it
via -G )
```
> cmake CMakeLists.txt [-G <makefile generator>]
```
[Special build instructions for Windows](doc/Build_Windows.md)

## Run the tests
Navigate to bin\debug or bin\release and run our test suite for rendering:
```
> bin\debug\osre_rendertest
```

### For Linux:
```
> make -j4
```

### For Windows: 
Use the generated Visual studio project files.
